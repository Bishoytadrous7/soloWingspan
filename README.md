## üéÆ Game Overview

Wingspan is a card-based engine-building game where you play bird cards to earn points through:

- Laid eggs
- Cached food
- Tucked cards

This simplified version removes some advanced mechanics (like round goals, bonus cards, powers that depend on other players) to focus on solo gameplay and AI strategy.
